title : History of Topsham Charter
description : The name Topsham is an Anglo-Saxon one and means Toppa's Village. Toppa was the local land owner. Topsham was designated a Town when it was granted a Royal Charter in August 1300. The Charter allowed Topsham to hold a weekly market, as it continues to do, and to celebrate Saints days. 
description2 : In August 2015 the last Carnival Day, which always ended town fayre week, was held. The first Charter Day replaced the Carnival Day in 2016 and our photograph shows our re-enactment of the granting of the Charter to the Earl of Devon.
